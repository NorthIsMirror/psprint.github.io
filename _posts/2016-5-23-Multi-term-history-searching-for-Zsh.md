title: Multi-term history searching for Zsh
---

I've written a project that might be perceived as lightweight alternative to
`n-history`. It allows to do multi-term searching on Zshell's history.

Based on `zle recursive-edit`, it's a nice, small piece of code that will
integrate smoothly with Zshell instead of providing a full-screen Curses
interface.  Highlighting of what is matched is still supported.
